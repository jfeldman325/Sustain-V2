        Given these Events:

    Scenario: Submiting a Summary for an event
        Given I am signed in with provider Google
        Given I am on the home page
        When I follow "Class 1"
        Then I follow "Register for this Event"
        Then I should see "You are now registered for the event Class 1"
        When I click on my name
        Then I should see my profile
        When I follow "Submit Event Summary"
        Then I should see "Add an Event Summary for Class 1"
        When I fill in "Summary" with "whats up"
        And I press "Submit this summary"
        Then I should see my profile
        And I should see "Summary created for 'Class 1'"
