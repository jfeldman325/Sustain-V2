Feature: View an event
    As an admin
    so that I can see the details and check the participation of an event
    I want to be able to view the details and attendance of each event and class.

    Background: the website already has some existing events and users
       Given these Events:
            | id | title           |  location        | recurring | points | description                     |

            | 2  | Non-recurring 1 |  Love Auditorium | no        | 1      | Guest Speaker on Global Warming |

        Given these users:
            | name         | classification |
            | John Cane    | Faculty        |
            | Thomas Smith | Student        |

        Given these Occurrences:

            | 2        | November 2, 2018 7:00 PM |

       Given these participants:
            | eventDate                 | user_id | event_id |
            | November 2, 2017 07:00 PM |   1     | 2        |
